# Sparnatural - A natural way of building SPARQL queries

Sparnatural is a **visual SPARQL query builder written in javascript**.

It supports the creation of basic graph patterns with the selection of values with autocomplete search or dropdown lists. It can be configured through a JSON-LD or OWL configuration file (that can be edited in Protégé) that defines the classes and properties to be presented in the component.

This is a fork of the main repository. The changes made are mainly about using the MatVoc vocabulary on a GraphDB store.
